Hi! I’m Elizzzabeth ig. I’m a media design student from a small town now studying in the city. But I don’t get out enough that it doesn’t feel like the city other than the amount of time it takes to travel to places. <br> My days are usually spent doing or planning to do work, admiring nature, consuming stories, listening to music, and communicating with friends/family. <br> Location: Sitting down :P </p>
  
<ul>
  <li>Creative writing</li>
  <li>Listening to music</li>
  <li>Digital art</li>
